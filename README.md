## Visualisation

Since I pretty much made the same thing last year I decided to also make visualisations for the data. The way I did it was a bit rough but it worked out pretty well. Very satisfying putting the data to good use.
1. Create a square matrix of the similarity % between each person and each other person 
2. Standardise data with the default standard scaler
3. Feed the whole thing into the PCA algorithm
4. Apply KMeans clustering for nice colouring
5. Put the names next to the dots
